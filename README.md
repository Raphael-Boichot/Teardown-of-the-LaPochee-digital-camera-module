# Teardown of the LaPochée（ラポッシュ）digital camera module

The Lapochée is a digital camera module accompanying the THZ43 Chiaro mobile phone released in May 1999 by Tu-Ka mobile phone company and operator (then merged in KDDI Corporation). Both phone and camera module were made by Mitsubishi. This is technically the **first mobile phone equipped with a digital camera** (and among the first low-end market digital cameras too) so it kind of belong to history.

Fun fact, "LaPochée" is probably a name designed to sound cute and French but it means nothing in French apart an approximate translation of "The pocket" ("La Poche").

The LaPochée camera module acquired a certain celebrity in the niche Game Boy nerds community as it shows a potential hardware filiation with the Game Boy Camera according to various Mitsibishi sources frome 1999-2000. It might or might not share the same analog light sensor from the M6428X series. I tried to find this camera module for years. By the time, addict to old electronic stuff I landed on some M64283FP sensors from factory (possibly used in the LaPochée) by pure luck and published [Arduino codes codes to drive them](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Play-with-the-Mitsubishi-M64283FP-sensor). The M64283FP sensor is basically a Game Boy Camera M64282FP sensor with more functions and the same shitty datasheet. You will see why I insist on this sensor later.

I finally got the Lapochée camera module in March 2025 thanks to a local contact in Japan (see aknowledgments). The device was advertised as electronic junk but in pristine state according to seller images. It was delivered in its factory plastic bag still with the protective film on front face. Sadly for me, the display was burnt beyond repair (both the polarizer and the liquid crytal part were completely dark). This is common with Japanese product and due to overheating.

But I guess you landed here for some good old vintage electronic porn and not to see a draw my life.

The device exudes the 2000s with its white round design anf the touch of blue plastic.

The right side features the on/off button and a contrast thumbwheel for the display. The device has no LED or speaker / buzzer to indicate its state. It's completely mute. Mine shows no sign of life due to defective display.

The bottom shows the communication port with the mobile phone. The port is a 8 pins something that I cannot identify. It's not a common plug.

The back side shows the battery compartment and a 3 positions stand. Not sure why the stand is longer than the device itself. Design I guess...

The device works with 2xAAA batteries which was a very fancy use before the flooding of market with shitty lithium batteries.
